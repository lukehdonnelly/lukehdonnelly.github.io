		<h1>You head through the door which has the smoke coming under it. After entering the door, you see a strange, lantern like figure with a face and a long tongue sticking out. This lantern is a Yokai, or Japanese demon or spirit, called chochin obake, which means paper lantern ghost, which could apparently suck out your soul scaring you. Luckily for you, you weren't scared by the lantern as it was not expecting you. You decide to leave, however, as you go you bump into something you can't see and a Nurikabe appears, an invisible Yokai whos purpose is to block travellers from passing through certain areas and is thought to be the reason why some Japanese traverlers get lost. You also heard that you could use a stick and tap the bottom left corner of the wall</h1>
		<br/>
		<h1>Do you walk past or try to use the stick from the lantern Yokai to tap the bottom left corner?</h1>
